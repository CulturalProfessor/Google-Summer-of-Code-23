## Challenges Faced ü§î
- <b>Iframe Inefficiency</b>: Our initial Iframe approach lacked scalability and flexibility.

- <b>Webpack Transition</b>: Adapting to Webpack for bundling and serving posed technical hurdles and learning curves.

- <b>Real-time Previews</b>: Generating and storing real-time previews in base64 format demanded efficient coding and handling.

- <b>External Files Storage</b>: Managing external files storage added complexity to the project's infrastructure and data handling.

## Future Work üîÆ
- <b>Implement Live Collaboration</b>: Enabling live collaboration is a complex task because it involves integrating Excalidraw's collaboration features, which rely on websockets. However, there's a challenge because the Rocket.Chat App's Engine currently doesn't support sockets. The future goal here is to overcome this challenge and find a way to implement live collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on a whiteboard simultaneously and in real-time.

- <b>Implement a Context Bar</b>: To enhance the usability and management of boards, the project aims to implement a Context Bar. This feature will provide a user-friendly interface for users to easily navigate and manage their boards. It could include options to switch between different boards, organize and categorize boards, and access board-specific settings. The goal is to make the user experience more intuitive and efficient when working with multiple whiteboards.
